# passGen64
a simple python Password Generator
the GUI is not built yet, it is a file used to save previous written code. 
The next steps are to create a website for people to access passGen64 and create their own passwords!

The only code that works is the passgen.py currently
Download a copy of this code and run it in your box that has python!
Good luck
